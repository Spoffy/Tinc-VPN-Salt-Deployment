This selection of states, pillars and file templates allows a salt master to quickly configure a Tinc VPN.

# Configuration

All host and VPN specific configuration is done in the `tinc_config.sls` file.

All hosts should have the `tinc.sls` state applied to them.

See `examples` for more information.
